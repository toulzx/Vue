# Failed to load the ESLint library

To use ESLint please install eslint by running npm install eslint in the workspace folder JavaScript_Info
or globally using 'npm install -g eslint'. You need to reopen the workspace after installing eslint.

If you are using yarn or pnpm instead of npm set the setting `eslint.packageManager` to either `yarn` or `pnpm`
Alternatively you can disable ESLint for the workspace folder JavaScript_Info by executing the 'Disable ESLint' command.

__Attention__: you have to run `npm install -g eslint` with Administrator Permission after close the IDW.
